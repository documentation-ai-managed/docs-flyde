## Document Organization

Create a logical folder structure to keep your documentation scalable. Flyde supports unlimited nesting, custom sidebar menus, and automatic indexing.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Folders" icon="folder-plus">
    Navigate to your workspace root and select **New Folder**. Name it based on your project sections, such as `guides/` or `api/`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Documents" icon="file-text">
    Inside a folder, create MDX pages. Flyde auto-generates navigation links.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reorder Structure" icon="move">
    Drag and drop folders and files in the sidebar to customize the hierarchy.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use frontmatter in your MDX files to set custom order: `order: 1`.
</Callout>

## Team Collaboration

Invite team members to co-edit docs without version conflicts. Flyde offers real-time editing, comments, and approval workflows.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Editor Role" icon="edit-3">
    Make live changes with cursor indicators showing who edits what.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Reviewer Role" icon="eye">
    Add inline comments and suggest edits. Approve changes before publishing.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Admin Role" icon="shield">
    Manage permissions and resolve merge conflicts automatically.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

For programmatic collaboration, use the Flyde API:

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
  ```javascript
  const flyde = new FlydeClient({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });
  await flyde.docs.inviteUser('user@example.com', 'editor');
  ```
  ```python
  from flyde import FlydeClient
  client = FlydeClient(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')
  client.docs.invite_user('user@example.com', 'editor')
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Version History

Every edit creates a snapshot. You view diffs, revert changes, or branch docs for experiments.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Initial Doc] --> B[Edit 1]
    B --> C[Edit 2]
    C --> D[Current]
    D --> E[Revert to B]
    style E fill:#f0f0f0
```

<Expandable title="Advanced Versioning" default-open="false">
  Access full history via API. Compare versions side-by-side.

  ```javascript
  const versions = await flyde.docs.getVersions('guide.mdx');
  const diff = await flyde.docs.diff(versions[0], versions[1]);
  ```
</Expandable>

## Search and Tagging

Quickly find content with full-text search and tags. Assign tags in frontmatter for filtering.

| Feature       | Description                          | Example Usage                  |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Full-Text Search | Searches titles, content, and metadata | `api integration` finds all API docs |
| Tags          | Custom labels for categorization     | `tags: ["feature", "guide"]`  |
| Advanced Filters | Combine search with tags/folders     | `status: draft AND api`       |

<Callout kind="info">
  Tags sync across your workspace. Use them to power dynamic menus.
